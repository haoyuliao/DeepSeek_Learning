Surfing: the sport or pastime of riding a wave towards the shore while standing or lying on a surfboard. Swimming: swimming. Wildlife viewing: the act of observing wild animals and plants in their natural environment. Landscape aesthetics: the enjoyment and pleasure felt through the observation of environmental scenery.
